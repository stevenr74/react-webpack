TODO:

recommendation logic
add games to db  - use a pk for identiy instead of generating one in imagecontainer
separate db logic from app

Implementation:


Flow:
User selects games they like (1-max) -> second row of suggestions appear based on selected game(s).
Weightings are used to decide recommendations. There are a couple of ways to do this
    option1 : load all games, use filters to find ones that match the selected. good: covers all games  bad: slow, not realistic with a larger set of data
    option2: using a score -> if genre has a match, return games with highest scores. good: less calculations, covers all games but gets the best ones only. bad: score pregenartion? 

-> How the hell do you realistically score a game for different kinds of players?
    weighting based on genres they like
    so a score should be relative to other games in that genre
    mode - multiplayer vs singleplayer vs coop vs MMO
